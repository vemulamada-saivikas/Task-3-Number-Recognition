# Task-3-Number-Recognition
As part of Bharath Intern virtual internship, this is my third task : Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects  scanned images of handwritten digits. Hand written digit recognition using MNST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.
